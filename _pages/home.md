## About Me  
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science) advised by Professor [Jianxi Gao](https://www.gaojianxi.com).
I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [Ishtiaque Ahmed](https://www.ishtiaque.net). 

 
I'm interested in the dynamics and learning behaviors of complex systems, spanning networked dynamical processes and modern language models. My work focuses on networked dynamical systems, including reverse engineering, network inference, and time series prediction, with applications to understanding neural network training dynamics. I am also broadly interested in exploring the behaviors of language models, such as in-context learning and task-level inference.

## Earlier Projects

* [**Inter-coder Reliability**](https://github.com/dingyanna/intercoder-reliability)

    University of Toronto    Supervisor: [Prof. Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com)   Summer 2020
 
     During research analysis, such as categorizing social media posts, different researchers often have to label a shared dataset. It is essential to determine inter-coder reliability in order to make the research results more convincing in this case. This project implements a standalone application to calculate different inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., [Scott's Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_Pi)).

* **COVID-19 Related Stigma On Social Media**

    University of Toronto  Supervisor: [Prof. Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed](https://www.ishtiaque.net) Summer 2020 - Present 
 
    The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased stigma, prejudice, and hate against people of East Asian descent living in North America and around the world. In particular, those individuals perceived to be from China or to a Chinese-heritage are frequently targeted on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. This project studies the stigma, fear, and misinformation on social media related to COVID-19. It aims to increase public awareness of the harm and impact of stigma and reduce the spread of stigma. During the project, I collected and maintained a dataset of 650+ million tweets, including 220k potentially stigmatizing tweets with [geo-location data](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/tweet-geo-metadata); visualized and analyzed various statistical metrics on the previous data, including distribution of sentiment (labeled by [the BERT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))) around the globe.
