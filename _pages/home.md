## About Me  
I am a Computer Science PhD student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://science.rpi.edu/computer-science) advised by Professor [Jianxi Gao](https://www.gaojianxi.com).
My research interests include reverse engineering network dynamics, utilizing network reduction approaches to understand complex systems in ecology, biology, etc. 

I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor [Ishtiaque Ahmed](https://www.ishtiaque.net).

## Research 
 
Social, biological, and neural networks exhibit intricate behaviors governed by <u>coupled dynamical systems</u>. 
Each node within these networks is tied to a time-series of states, driven by either ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or partial differential equations (PDEs). These states can represent diverse phenomena such as species abundance in ecosystems, gene expression levels in regulatory networks, political opinions, or phases in oscillator networks. Understanding network dynamics is paramount across various domains in network theory. It aids in forecasting future system states, studying critical phase transitions from system survival to collapse, and exploring signal propagation patterns. Despite technological advancements granting increased accessibility to network states (e.g., two-photon calcium imaging, high-throughput sequencing technologies), deciphering the underlying dynamical system remains challenging due to  nonlinear dynamics and coupling between <u>thousands of millions of nodes</u>. My research focuses on developing streamlined techniques for uncovering network dynamics. I aim to create efficient methods that effectively reduce complex systems while preserving important aspects of the original dynamics.

## Earlier Projects

* [**Inter-coder Reliability**](https://github.com/dingyanna/intercoder-reliability)

    University of Toronto    Supervisor: [Prof. Priyank Chandra](https://www.priyankc.com)   Summer 2020
 
    |During research analysis, such as categorizing social media posts, different researchers often have to label a shared dataset. It is essential to determine inter-coder reliability in order to make the research results more convincing in this case. This project implements a standalone application to calculate different inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., [Scott's Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_Pi)). ![demo](/assets/demo.gif)|

* **COVID-19 Related Stigma On Social Media**

     University of Toronto  Supervisor: [Prof. Syed Ishtiaque Ahmed](https://www.ishtiaque.net) Summer 2020 - Present 
 
    |The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased stigma, prejudice, and hate against people of East Asian descent living in North America and around the world. In particular, those individuals perceived to be from China or to a Chinese-heritage are frequently targeted on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. This project studies the stigma, fear, and misinformation on social media related to COVID-19. It aims to increase public awareness of the harm and impact of stigma and reduce the spread of stigma. During the project, I collected and maintained a dataset of 650+ million tweets, including 220k potentially stigmatizing tweets with [geo-location data](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/tweet-geo-metadata); visualized and analyzed various statistical metrics on the previous data, including distribution of sentiment (labeled by [the BERT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))) around the globe. ![timeline](/assets/timeline.gif)|
