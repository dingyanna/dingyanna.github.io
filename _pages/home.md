## Projects

* **[Inter-coder Reliability](https://github.com/dingyanna/intercoder-reliability-app)**

    |University of Toronto \| Summer 2020 |
    | ------------------|
    |During research analysis such as categorizing social media posts, we often involve different researchers to label a set of common posts. It is essential to determine inter-coder reliability in order to make the research results more convincing in this case. This project implements a standalone application to calculate different inter-rater reliability metrics (e.g., [Scott's Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott%27s_Pi)).|

* **COVID-19 Related Stigma On Social Media**

    |University of Toronto \| Summer 2020 - Present |
    | ------------------|
    |This project studies the stigma, fear, and misinformation on social media related to COVID-19.|

## Personal Interests
